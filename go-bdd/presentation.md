# Welcome!

BDD Development in Golang, using Cucumber

![22](src/imgs/scientist.png)

---
# What is BDD?

An extension of TDD (I know...) that emphasizes feature development around user stories.

I'm assuming we, for the most part, use user stories here.

---
# What is cucumber?

A test process written in the gherkin language, which expresses tests in natual language.

This brings the advantage of:

<!-- stop -->

- Non-technical members of an organisation can understand & contribute to test suites
<!-- stop -->

- Developers who are less familiar / experienced can understand & contribute to test suites
<!-- stop -->

- The tests themselves can become firm, unambiguous acceptance requirements


---
# What is cucumber?

Gherkin has the following keywords:

```gherkin
Given a precondition
 And another precondition
When I do an action
Then I should have some result
 And I should have some other result
```

---
# What is cucumber?

Gherkin has the following keywords:

```gherkin
Given I seed the database with "some_test_data.sql"
 And I login as user "admin"
When I send a GET request to "/contacts"
Then the response code should be OK
 And the response body should match "some_truth_source.json"
```

---
# What is cucumber?
Cucumber tests have three main entities:

## Steps
A single instruction. These are written in natural language, and are akin to well define functions in an integration test suite, such as `s.createUser(dbConn)`.

<!-- stop -->

```gherkin
Given I login as "admin"
```
```gherkin
Then the response body should match "account_created.json"
```

<!-- stop -->

## Scenario
A collection of steps structured to test some functionality, or test case. Scenarios are given a description declaring what exactly they are testing.

Think of a scenario as a `Test` function in your integration test suite, `func TestAccount_Create(t *testing.T)`. Like a test function, they are independent and can be executed concurrently.

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/features/account.feature
lang: gherkin
lines:
    start: 8
    end: 16
```

<!-- stop -->

## Features
The feature being tested.  Features give a description of what should be tested, and can declare rules / criteria for documentation purposes.

Features are akin to `_test.go` files in your integration test suite.

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/features/account.feature
lang: gherkin
lines:
    start: 0
    end: 7
```

---
# What is cucumber?

Putting this all this together we get:
```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/features/account.feature
lang: gherkin
```

---
# Ok, where does go come into this?

Obviously we can't just run these feature files, we need to somehow link our natural langauge with code. Ideally, we'd use a framework provided from the cucumber group.

Luckily, we have just that.

<!-- stop -->

# Using godog

There are two ways to bake godog into your test suite.

1. Using \*testing.T
<!-- stop -->

1. Using \*testing.M
<!-- stop-->

Both of these are fine, but for this talk we're doing to focus on \*testing.M as it is, in my opinion, easier for integration testing.

---
# What is cucumber?

Imagine we an account entity, and wanted to test its `Withdraw` functionality.

When funds are withdrawn, the account balance is updated to reflect this withdrawal.

If the funds requested exceed the balance, the balance isn't touched, instead we relay an error.

<!-- stop -->

The unit tests for this service may look like this:

```file
path: code/ex1/account_test.go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g'
lang: go
lines:
  start: 9
  end: null
```

---
# What is cucumber?
The same service, using a cucumber framework, would look like so:

```file
path: code/ex2/features/account.feature
lang: gherkin
transform: 'sed /@account/d'
lines:
   start: 0
   end: 14
```
<!-- stop -->

Much easier read.

---

# Show me the golang!

## Getting started

To begin, we create our `TestMain` function and build our test suite struct:

```file
path: code/ex2/account_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/   /g;/flag/d'
lines:
  start: 21
  end: 35
```

---
# Show me the golang!

## Wiring up our steps

Inside the scenario initialiser we map all naturual langauge steps to a corresponding golang function.

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: code/ex2/account_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/   /g;/BeforeStep\|time.Sleep\|})\|deposit/d;'
lines:
  start: 39
  end: 45
```

---
# Show me the golang!

## Wiring up our steps

We can also define `BeforeStep`, `AfterStep`, `BeforeScenario` and `AfterScenario` hooks.

```file
path: code/ex2/account_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/   /g;/deposit/d;'
lines:
  start: 39
  end: 48
```

---

# Show me the golang!
## Wiring up our steps

Step functions can:
- take `context.Context` as their first argument. If this is present, godog will build and supply a context.
- return `context.Context` as their first return. If this is present, godog will pass the returned context to future steps.
- take typed parameters.

```file
path: code/ex2/account_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/   /g'
lines:
  start: 49
  end: 87
```

---
# Show me the golang!

## And that's it!

We now have a test suite we can run.

<!-- stop -->

```terminal-ex
command: zsh -il
rows: 30
init_text: cd code/ex2/; go test -v ./account_test.go
init_wait: '> '
init_codeblock_lang: zsh
```

---
# Running a subset
With the `testing.M` approach, all test execution is done via the godog api.

Luckily godog exposes a nice way to run a subset of tests.

<!-- stop -->

Let's say we added new `Deposit` functionality to our service, and wanted to run only these deposit tests:

```file
path: code/ex2/features/account.feature
lang: gherkin
transform: sed '/ *\(When\|Then\|And\)/d;s/^.*Given.*$/   \# Scenario definition/g'
```

---
# Running a subset

We can then selectively run these scenarios with the `--godog.tags=` flag:

<!-- stop -->

```terminal-ex
command: zsh -il
rows: 30
init_text: cd code/ex2/; go test -v ./account_test.go --godog.tags=deposit
init_wait: '> '
init_codeblock_lang: zsh
```

---
# Running randomly

Scenarios can be executed in a random order using `--godog.random`, ensuring tests are not dependent on one another

<!-- stop -->

```terminal-ex
command: zsh -il
rows: 30
init_text: cd code/ex2/; go test -v ./account_test.go --godog.random
init_wait: '> '
init_codeblock_lang: zsh
```

---
# Running concurrently

Scenarios can be executed concurrently using `--godog.concurrency=num_procs`:

<!-- stop -->

```terminal-ex
command: zsh -il
rows: 30
init_text: cd code/ex2/; go test -v ./account_test.go --godog.concurrency=4
init_wait: '> '
init_codeblock_lang: zsh
```

---
# So this relatively contrived example is cool and all, but like, we're still a long way away from integration tests!

Some basic functions of integration test suites are:
1. Direct database access to prime data
<!-- stop -->

2. Some http or grpc client to perform requests
<!-- stop -->

3. Test data, in the form of structs in the code, or files on the filesystem.

<!-- stop -->

So let's add these!

---

# Build a global suite

We're going to want a test suite struct that holds global clients to be used across scenarios:

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g'
lines:
  start: 47
  end: 58
```

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/data/data.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g'
lines:
  start: 7
  end: null
```

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g'
lines:
  start: 25
  end: 31
```

---

# Let's build this suite

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g;s/err/_/;/lookatme:ignore/d'
lines:
  start: 63
  end: 98
```

---

# Define our steps

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g;;/lookatme:ignore/d'
lines:
  start: 98
  end: 107
```

<!-- stop -->

Notice that the step funcs now have `Suite` as a receiver. This is so they can access the db connection and http client.

---

# Running SQL from a database connection

```gherkin
Given I run the SQL "init_dev_data.sql"
```

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g;;/lookatme:ignore/d'
lines:
  start: 108
  end: 117
```

---

# Setting headers for a http request

```gherkin
Given the headers:
  | key           | value      |
  | Authorization | Bearer dev |
  | X-Request-ID  | 12345      |
```

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g;;/lookatme:ignore/d'
lines:
  start: 209
  end: 222
```

---

# Making a http request

```gherkin
When I make a POST request to "/api/v1/myendpoint" using "POST-my-request.json"
```

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g;;/lookatme:ignore/d'
lines:
  start: 121
  end: 156
```

---

# Checking the response code (incomplete)
```gherkin
Then the response status should be BAD_REQUEST
```

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g;;/lookatme:ignore/d'
lines:
  start: 157
  end: 175
```

---

# Finally, checking the response body
```gherkin
Then the response body should match "errs/bad-request.json"
```

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g;;/lookatme:ignore/d'
lines:
  start: 176
  end: 209
```
