# Welcome!

BDD Development in Golang, using Cucumber

---
# What is BDD?

An extension of TDD (I know...) that emphasizes feature development around user stories.

I'm assuming we, for the most part, use user stories here.

---
# What is cucumber?

A test process written in the gherkin language, which expresses tests in natual language.

This brings the advantage of:

<!-- stop -->

- Non-technical members of an organisation can understand / contribute to test suites
<!-- stop -->

- Developers who are less familiar / experienced can understand / contribute to test suites
<!-- stop -->

- The tests themselves can become firm, unambiguous acceptance requirements


---
# What is cucumber?

Gherkin has the following keywords:

```gherkin
Given a precondition
 And another precondition
When I do an action
Then I should have some result
 And I should have some other result
```

---
# What is cucumber?

Gherkin has the following keywords:

```gherkin
Given I seed the database with "some_test_data.sql"
 And I login as user "admin"
When I send a GET request to "/contacts"
Then the response code should be OK
 And the response body should match "some_truth_source.json"
```

---
# What is cucumber?
Cucumber tests have three main entities:

## Steps
A single instruction. These are written in natural language, and are akin to well define functions in an integration test suite, such as `s.createUser(dbConn)`.

<!-- stop -->

```gherkin
Given I login as "admin"
```
```gherkin
Then the response body should match "account_created.json"
```

<!-- stop -->

## Scenario
A collection of steps structured to test some functionality, or test case. Scenarios are given a description declaring what exactly they are testing.

Think of a scenario as a `Test` function in your integration test suite, `func TestAccount_Create(t *testing.T)`. Like a test function, they are independent and can be executed concurrently.

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/feature_header.feature
lang: gherkin
lines:
    start: 7
    end: 12
```

<!-- stop -->

## Features
The feature being tested.  Features give a description of what should be tested, and can declare rules / criteria for documentation purposes.

Features are akin to `_test.go` files in your integration test suite.

<!-- stop -->

```file
path: src/examples/feature_header.feature
lang: gherkin
lines:
    start: 0
    end: 6
```

---
# What is cucumber?

Putting all this together we get:
```file
path: src/examples/feature_header.feature
lang: gherkin
```

---
# Ok, where does go come into this?

Obviously we can't just run these feature files, we need to somehow link our natural langauge with code. Ideally, we'd use a framework provided from the cucumber group.

Luckily, we have just that.

<!-- stop -->

https://github.com/cucumber/godog

---

# Using godog

There are two ways to bake godog into your test suite.

1. Using \*testing.T
<!-- stop -->

1. Using \*testing.M
<!-- stop-->

Both of these are fine, but for this talk we're doing to focus on \*testing.M as it is, in my opinion, easier for integration testing.

---
# What is cucumber?

Imagine we an account entity, and wanted to test its `Withdraw` functionality.

When funds are withdrawn, the account balance is updated to reflect this withdrawal.

If the funds requested exceed the balance, the balance isn't touched, instead we relay an error.

<!-- stop -->

The unit tests for this service may look like this:

```file
path: code/ex1/account_test.go
transform: sed 's/\t/    /g'
lang: go
```

---
# What is cucumber?
The same service, using a cucumber framework, would look like so:

```file
path: code/ex2/features/account.feature
lang: gherkin
```
<!-- stop -->

Much easier read.

# Show me the golang!

## Getting started

To begin, we create our `TestMain` function and build our test suite struct:

```file
path: code/ex2/account_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/   /g'
lines:
  start: 11
  end: 24
```

---
# Show me the golang!

## Wiring up our steps

Inside the scenario initialiser we:
1. build our scenario's context, an entity holding all information needed for a test case.
<!-- stop -->

1. map all naturual langauge steps to a corresponding golang function. To share data between these functions, we create a shared context that's specific to that scenario.
<!-- stop -->

```file
path: code/ex2/account_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/   /g;/BeforeStep\|time.Sleep\|})/d;'
lines:
  start: 23
  end: 39
```

---

# Show me the golang!
## Wiring up our steps

And each of these functions mutate the state of the context.

```file
path: code/ex2/account_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/   /g'
lines:
  start: 41
  end: null
```

---
# Show me the golang!

## And that's it!

We now have a test suite we can run.

<!-- stop -->

```terminal-ex
command: zsh -il
rows: 30
init_text: cd code/ex2/; go test -v ./account_test.go
init_wait: '> '
init_codeblock_lang: zsh
```


---
# Show me the golang!

## Defining a step

Within our scenario initialiser, we wire up any/all steps that scenario might expect (generally all of them).

```file
path: src/examples/bank/test/integration/integration_test.go
lang: go
transform: sed 's/\t/   /g'
lines:
  start: 20
  end: null
```
---

```gherkin
Then the response code should be CREATED
```

```go
// implementation
sc.Step(`Then the response code should be (\w+)$`, func(status string) error {
    code, ok := map[string]int{
        "OK":      http.StatusOK,
        "CREATED": http.StatusCreated,
        // etc
    }[status]
    if !ok {
        return errors.Errorf("unrecognised status code '%s'", status)
    }

    // check status code
})
```

To make a step executable they are paired with functions, and on a regex match that function is executed with any captured expressions provided as parameters.


```go
// ex2

func InitScenario(sc *godog.ScenarioContext) {
    ctx := struct {
        records []string
    }{}

    sc.Step(`^I say "([^"]+)" (\d+) times$`, func(phrase string, times int64) {
        for i := 0; i < times; i++ {
            ctx.records = append(ctx.records, phrase)
        }
    })

    sc.Step(`^I should have (\d+) records of "([^"]+)"$`, func(expected int64, phrase string) error {
        if expected != len(ctx.records) {
            return errors.Errorf("expected %d records, got %d", expected, len(ctx.records))
        }

        for i, record := range ctx.records {
            if record != phrase {
                return errors.Errorf("expected record %d to be %s, got %s", i, phrase, record)
            }
        }
    })
}
```

```gherkin
Scenario: I can speak
  Given I say "hello world" 7 times
  Then I should have 7 records of "hello world"
```

# Example

Take the following golang unit test:

```go
// models.go
type Plate struct {
    Contents PlateItems
}

type PlateItems map[PlateItem]int

type PlateItem int

const (
    PlateItemSausage      PlateItem = iota
    PlateItemBacon
    PlateItemEggsPoached
    PlateItemToastSlice
)

type Person struct {}

func (p Person) EatFrom(plate *Plate, items PlateItems) {
    // definition
}

// person_test.go
func Test_Eat(t *testing.T) {
    person := models.Person{}

    plate := models.Plate{
        Contents: models.PlateItems{
            models.PlateItemSausage:     2,
            models.PlateItemBacon:       3,
            models.PlateItemEggsPoached: 2,
            models.PlateItemToastSlice:  2,
        }
    }

    person.EatFrom(&plate, models.PlateItems{
        models.PlateItemSausage:    1,
        models.PlateItemToastSlice: 2,
    })

    assert.Equal(t, plate, &models.PlateItems{
        models.PlateItemSausage:     1,
        models.PlateItemBacon:       3,
        models.PlateItemEggsPoached: 2,
    })
}
```

---
# A world in cucumber
The same test couple be written as follows:
```gherkin
Scenario: Eaten food is removed from plate
  Given I have a plate with:
    | item           | quantity |
    | sausage        | 2        |
    | bacon          | 3        |
    | poached egg    | 2        |
    | slice of toast | 2        |
  When I eat:
    | item           | quantity |
    | sausage        | 1        |
    | slice of toast | 2        |
  Then the plate should be left with:
    | item           | quantity |
    | sausage        | 1        |
    | bacon          | 3        |
    | poached egg    | 2        |

```

# What is cucumber?

Features a store in txt files, typically having in files with a `.feature` extension.

```terminal-ex
command: zsh -il

init_text: tree -I vendor code/ex2
init_wait: '> '
init_codeblock_lang: zsh

# What's wrong with Golang?

The problem isn't with golang in particular, but instead writing usage tests in a programming language.

To understand why this is a problem we should consider what makes a test suite a good.

---
# A good test suite

Follows the "even juniors" rule.

1. Is extendable.
      - Even juniors should be able to make meaning contributions.
2. Is approachable
      - Even juniors should be able to understand it.
3. Covers core usage cases.

4. Acts as documentation for the codebase.

---
# 1. Is understandable.

Code is easy to write, but hard to read.

In the same vein, navigation code that adheres to good principles involves lots of jumping about.

---
# Why?

Writing tests is boring.

Writing integration tests are especially boring.

Reading integration tests is worse.

---
# Problems with Golang based integration tests

As mentioned, the tests are hard to read.

Code is easy to write, but hard to read.

No matter how extensive the documentation, you will have codebases that
do the same thing in vastly different ways.

So naturally a test framework written in native code will have
the same problems.

---
# Example

Take this example found from medium.com after searching "golang integration tests":

```go
func (s *e2eTestSuite) Test_EndToEnd_GetAllArticle() {
    article := model.Article{
        Title:   "my-title",
        Author:  "my-author",
        Content: "my-content",
    }

    s.NoError(s.dbConn.Create(&article).Error)

    req, err := http.NewRequest(echo.GET, fmt.Sprintf("http://localhost:%d/articles", s.port), nil)
    s.NoError(err)

    req.Header.Set(echo.HeaderContentType, echo.MIMEApplicationJSON)

    client := http.Client{}
    response, err := client.Do(req)
    s.NoError(err)
    s.Equal(http.StatusOK, response.StatusCode)

    byteBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
    s.NoError(err)

    s.Equal(`{"status":200,"message":"Success","data":[{"id":1,"title":"my-title","content":"my-content","author":"my-author"}]}`, strings.Trim(string(byteBody), "\n"))
    response.Body.Close()
}
```

Almost all of this is boilerplate that needs to be duplicated in future tests.

---
# Example

Let's make it less boilerplate via well defined functions:

```go
func (s *e2eTestSuite) Test_EndToEnd_GetAllArticle() {
    s.NoError(s.dbInsert(model.Article{
            Title:   "my-title",
            Author:  "my-author",
            Content: "my-content",
        }
    ))

    respBody, err := s.httpGetJSONMustOK("/articles")
    s.NoError(err)

    s.Equal(`{"status":200,"message":"Success","data":[{"id":1,"title":"my-title","content":"my-content","author":"my-author"}]}`, strings.Trim(string(respBody), "\n"))
    response.Body.Close()
}
```

This is definitely better, but now we have a highly specific `httpGetJSONMustOK` function which assignes headers
and requires a 200 status code. If we want granularity we have to implement more specfic use case functions.

---
# Example

Well what about...
```go
func (s *e2eTestSuite) Test_EndToEnd_GetAllArticle() {
    s.NoError(s.dbInsert(model.SignUp{
            Email:    "mycoolemail@wow.com",
            Password: "abc123",
        }
    ))

    headers := http.Header{}
    headers.Set(echo.HeaderContentType, echo.MIMEApplicationJSON)

    respBody, statusCode, err := s.httpGet("/createaccount", headers)
    s.NoError(err)
    s.Equal(http.StatusOK, response.StatusCode)

    s.Equal(`{"status":200,"message":"Success","data":[{"id":1,"email":"mycoolemail@wow.com"}]}`, strings.Trim(string(respBody), "\n"))
    response.Body.Close()
}
```

---
# What about this?

```gherkin
Scenario: I can retrieve all articles
  Given I seed the database with "insert_article.sql"
  When I send a GET request to "/articles"
  Then the http response code should be OK
  And the response should match "articles.json"
```

---
# Or this
Scenario: I can retrieve all articles
  Given an aritcle in the database
  When I retrieve all articles
  Then the http response code should be OK
  And the response should match all articles
